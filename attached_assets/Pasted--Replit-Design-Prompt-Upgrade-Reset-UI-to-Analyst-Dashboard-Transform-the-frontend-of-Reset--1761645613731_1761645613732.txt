🎨 Replit Design Prompt — “Upgrade Reset UI to Analyst Dashboard”

Transform the frontend of Reset (React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui) from a simple card layout into a dense, professional financial-analyst dashboard inspired by Aiera and Bloomberg panels.

🧭 Overall layout
	•	Switch from top navigation → persistent left sidebar with:
	•	App logo + name “ReSeek” (green MVP badge)
	•	Navigation sections:
	•	Dashboard
	•	Watchlist
	•	Events
	•	Transcripts
	•	Settings
	•	At bottom: small profile/avatar + logout.
	•	Keep main content area scrollable on the right with cards and grids.
	•	Use 3-column dashboard layout:
	•	Left column: Activity Feed / Live Right Now
	•	Center column: Latest & Upcoming Events
	•	Right column: Mentions / Insights / Watchlist

🧱 Dashboard page

Replace the simple “Latest Events” list with panels that look like:

Left column — “Live right now” & Activity Feed
	•	Horizontal list of circular company avatars for live events (like the colored dots in the reference).
	•	Below: chronological “activity feed” cards:
	•	Each entry: company logo, event title, short text (“MSFT mentioned guidance 3x in transcript”), small timestamp.
	•	Grouped by day (“Today”, “Yesterday”).
	•	Use subtle colored badges for companies (consistent color per ticker).

Center column — Latest & Upcoming Events
	•	Card grid:
	•	Each card shows company logo, ticker, quarter, and status badges:
	•	“LIVE”, “SUMMARY AVAILABLE”, “TRANSCRIPT UPLOADED”.
	•	Hover = slight scale-up, shadow highlight.
	•	Include small icons for transcript, audio, slides.
	•	“Upcoming Events” panel below with date chips (Today / Tomorrow / Next Week).

Right column — Mentions & Watchlist
	•	“Mentions in Transcript”: horizontal scroll list of quotes with colored highlights for company names (exactly like the reference).
	•	“Your Watchlist”: small stacked list with company avatar, name, and next event date.

⸻

🧩 Company Detail page
	•	Keep header (company logo + name + ticker + date + quarter).
	•	Tabs (Summary, Q&A, Transcript, Chat) remain, but move to sticky sub-nav bar just under header.
	•	Add subtle accent color per company (auto-generated hash from ticker).
	•	Add right sidebar for Quick Facts:
	•	Market cap, sector, last close, next earnings date (placeholder fields).
	•	“Summary” tab:
	•	Replace plain table with two cards:
	•	Key Highlights (bullets + timestamp chips)
	•	Key Quotes (quote block with colored side bar, CEO/CFO tag)
	•	“Transcript” tab: collapsible sections, highlight the selected quote when clicked from Summary.
	•	“Chat” tab: full-width chat interface with left transcript context panel (optional).

⸻

💅 Styling
	•	Use Tailwind with neutral grays (gray-950 bg for sidebar, gray-900 main bg, gray-100 text).
	•	Accent color: ReSeek green (#22C55E).
	•	Font: Inter or IBM Plex Sans for data readability.
	•	Light borders, 8px radius, subtle drop shadows.
	•	Use Lucide icons for events (clock, mic, file-text, bar-chart).
